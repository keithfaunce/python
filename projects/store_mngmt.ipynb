    "### Question: \n",
    "You are asked to build a simple inventory management system for storing and updating information about a retailer's products. Assume that this retail offers 5 products. For each product, the system stores a record of product inventory level (quantity) and the price. This information is stored in a file called \"inventory.txt\" (attached to the assignment). <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this file, each line represents a unique product following the format of: Product Name, Quantity, Price. Product characteristics are separated with comma (,) delimiters. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main operations provided by the system (listed below). When the system is started, the program should list these three operations and let the users choose which one to execute. These functionalities are as follows:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Generate overall statistics for the <u>entire inventory:</u> total quantity of all items, average price per item, the product with the minimum inventory (and its quantity) and the product with the maximum inventory (and its quantity).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Retrieve information (quantity, price, or both) for a given product\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Update information (quantity or price) for a given product\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the user makes a selection, the program should invoke a relevant <u><b>function</b></u> and complete the operation. The system should continue running (i.e., functionality selection should be provided to the user repeatedly) until the user kills the execution of the program (possibly with a unique input character). A suggested system design will have four functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Function 1</b>: display_system_operations<br>\n",
    "Inputs: None<br>\n",
    "Outputs: Print out operation information<br>\n",
    "Description: This function prints out all possible operations of the system for the user to choose.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Function 2</b>: generate_overall_stats<br>\n",
    "Inputs: None<br>\n",
    "Outputs: Print overall statistics<br>\n",
    "Description: This function generates the overall statistics for the <u>entire inventory</u>: total quantity of all items, average price per item (across the entire inventory), the product with the minimum inventory (and its quantity) and the product with the maximum inventory (and its quantity).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Function 3</b>: retrieve_information<br>\n",
    "Inputs: product name and information type (quantity or price or both)<br>\n",
    "Outputs: Print the information requested<br>\n",
    "Description: This function retrieves the relevant information for a given product, which is obtained from the user as an input.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Function 4</b>: update_information<br>\n",
    "Inputs: product name, information type (quantity or price), and the updated value<br>\n",
    "Outputs: Write to inventory file<br>\n",
    "Description: This function updates the quantity or the price of a given product in the inventory file.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Function 5</b>: main<br>\n",
    "Inputs: None<br>\n",
    "Outputs: Program execution<br>\n",
    "Description: The main function first imports (i.e., reads) the inventory text file into the memory and asks the user which of the specific operations / functionality that the user would like to perform. It should invoke the relevant function (described above) for the operation chosen by the user. Finally, it should ask the user if they want to re-run the program again or not. If not, then terminate.\n"
