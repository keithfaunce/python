**Keith Faunce**

This portfolio highlights a selection of my work in **Python**, with a focus on data analysis and problem-solving using **Pandas** and **NumPy**. Each project demonstrates different aspects of coding, from automating tasks to building analytical pipelines. 

_For machine learning models, training sets, and predictive analysis studies, please see the “Machine Learning” section of my portfolio._

## Mortality Data Analysis 1900-2012

The mortality data analysis explores child mortality rates (ages 1–19) in the U.S. from 1900–2012 using an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** framework. By the end of the analysis you can visualize how medical practices have drastically improved over roughly the last century.

_Data files can be found at the top of the notebook_
